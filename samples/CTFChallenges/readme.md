# Purpose of this extension

**This extension is meant for demo and training purposes.**

The extension implements different scenarios with bad-performing AL Code. Some examples:
 - Long-running queries
 - Running substantial code in OnAfterGetRecord
 - Listening for too many database triggers

You can run these scenarios and use the standard troubleshooting tools to identify the root cause.

The extension also contains a set of capture the flag debugging/snapshot debugging challenges.


In addition to getting some hands-on experience with these tools, the examples also make it easy to _demonstrate_ to others how the tools work.

# Installing the extension

Build the extension (e.g. against your Business Central Online sandbox environment).

Then upload the extension, either using the Extension Management page, or just publish the extension directly from VS Code.

# Running the scenarios

Use global search (alt-q) and search for the "Slow Code Examples" page (page 50100).

Once opened, the page will explain how to run the scenarios.
